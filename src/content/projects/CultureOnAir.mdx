Culture on Air is a fun experience built in Unity. Fly around the globe in a helicopter, and your Air Tune Curator (ATC) will play the hottest hits from the country you're hovering over.

I built Culture on Air during my semester abroad at IADE University in Lisbon. Inspired by all the new aspects I could discover in Portuguese culture, I wanted to create something that allowed everyone to dive into different cultures.  Having researched the power of music during a previous project - MelodyMates - regional Spotify charts seemed like the perfect choice.

Have a good flight!
