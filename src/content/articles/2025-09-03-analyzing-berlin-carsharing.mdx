When people take carsharing to go places, they often leave behind an unbalanced system.  

That's because often, people tend to enter or exit the same areas at similar times, together.  

How can we predict this, and optimize carsharing fleets to better serve urban mobility?  

This is exactly what I explored in my [bachelor thesis](#thesis) and further [spoke about](#pydata-talk) at PyData Berlin.
